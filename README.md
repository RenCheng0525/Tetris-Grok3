## **Overview**
**Tetris-Grok3** is a modern take on the classic **Tetris** game, featuring **real-time gameplay mechanics**, **adaptive AI**, and **dynamic difficulty adjustments**. Built with **HTML5 Canvas** and optimized for smooth performance, the game offers both manual and AI-driven play styles.

## **Features**

### **Core Gameplay**
- **Classic Tetris Mechanics**: Rotate, move, and drop blocks to clear lines and score points.
- **Smooth Animations**: Blocks transition seamlessly, with optimized rendering for fluid gameplay.
- **Game Over Detection**: The game ends when new blocks can no longer be placed.

### **AI and Difficulty Adjustments**
- **Manual & AI Mode**: Toggle between manual play and AI-assisted gameplay with a single button.
- **AI Optimization**: The AI evaluates moves based on multiple heuristics, such as:
  - **Lines Cleared** (higher priority)
  - **Height Control** (keeps blocks low)
  - **Hole Avoidance** (prevents trapped spaces)
  - **Bumpiness Reduction** (smoother board surface)
- **HATETRIS-Inspired Mode**: Instead of random blocks, the game sometimes gives you the worst possible block to increase difficulty.
